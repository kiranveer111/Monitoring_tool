    // This file is used to define database-specific configurations if needed,
    // but for simplicity, the core connection details are now directly in index.js
    // and passed to mysql2.
    // It's kept here to match the skeleton structure.

    // You might place more complex connection string builders or database-specific
    // utilities here if your application grows.
